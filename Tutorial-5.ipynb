    "Unix commands are built-in programs which can be invoked to perform tasks or get information about the operating system. The MacOS Terminal is a interface that allows you to interact with your computer through the form of a command line interface (CLI). The Terminal CLI uses Unix commands as directives. In the this tutorial, you will learn to use some basic UNIX commands and perform tasks through Terminal. "
